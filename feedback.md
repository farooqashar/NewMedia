Combining all of the feedback, I made the following changes/revisions to the project:

● Using an entirely new structure/format of the website in order to mirror a real personal
website, which can be found at https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/templates/iPortfolio/, in order to show the value of personal websites

● Added captions and some source citations to different figures

● Added the Google slides presentation onto the site itself for centralization of all materials

● Introduced elements of Slashdot and the early Internet days in the discussion

● Explained more economic significance and urgency in relation to personal websites

● Rewrote some distinctions between between LinkedIn and a personal website in
paragraph form for the case study

● Added a visual comparison of some features of both platforms in the case study section

● Cleaned up and make the comparison table neater

● Added a section of potential barriers to making a personal website

● Added a short summary section of major reasons why people are turning to personal
websites at this time: better user experience, more visibility, more advantageous features than other platforms like LinkedIn, and economic urgency to make yourself stand out among other candidates

● Added the actual personal website that the project website mirrors

● Added/embedded 8 personal websites to showcase the variety of style and content that
a personal website can take on

● Added a testimonials section to highlight how experts and other people frame personal
websites as in order to establish credibility

● Added more to the bibliography
